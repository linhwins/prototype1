<h2>Curious Cat </h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
(Game still needs to be fully implemented) A friendly yet challenging game of cat and mouse (literally!) with hidden objects and surprising encounters. Under high pressure, your exploration skills will be put to the test to see how much resources you can obtain in a given amount of time. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to feel happy and energetic! 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a exploring and collecting resources type of game. Players also have to be careful not to run into the mouse. 
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Player uses left/right arrow keys for horizontal movement such as going left or right, down arrow key to crouch or hide, and space bar to jump (such as from platform to platform or to pass an obstacle). Player can also collect resources and shoot at opponents. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game prototype is to test collision of objects and expansion of game screen. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Some unique aspects of this game is the animation effects, hidden effect of animated objects, targeting and shooting, and movement through multiple platforms. Levels will also be incorporated. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game takes place in Curious Cat’s owner house in London, England. Being left home alone, Curious Cat is on a mission to find as much as food as he can before the mean cat comes and steals all his food! Both cats can shoot using bullets made from catnips that can destroy the health of the victim. Occasionally, there may be a couple of little innocent mouses that happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. If either cat captures the mouse, they will be rewarded with an extra life. As Curious Cat passes each part of the house, a new level will be presented with more challenging obstacles. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
While his owner is on a business trip to Paris, Curious Cat is having the time of his life, running around and being free! Doing what cats love most, Curious Cat is taking naps, lounging around, and perhaps scratching a few of his owner’s favorite sofas? However, as the days progress, Curious Cat is running out of food and had forgotten where his owner had placed the extra food. Not only that, he realizes that he’s not alone! A mean, hungry cat had broken into his house and is on a mission to find the hidden food! Curious Cat is now on a time crunch to find all the food before they’re gone! He will have to use his catnip gun to protect himself and tries his best to capture any mouse that might cross his path to gain an extra life! Exploration and curiosity is the key! 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game will attract a lot of cat lovers and children! Even adults will find this game fun and relaxing. Pet owners will definitely find this game fun to play! 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
My game takes about 30 seconds to play. Once fully implemented, it may be a minute or two. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Main strategy is to jump on platforms to collect food and to be careful not to fall down since coming in contact with the mouse will cause player to lose a life!
</li>
